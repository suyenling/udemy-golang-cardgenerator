# udemy-golang-cardgenerator
This repository is for my first project in the ["Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/) Udemy course by Stephen Grider. It is a simple repository meant for me to learn Golang and Git at the same time.

In this first project, I will be using Go to create a program to pull random cards from a virtual deck of 52.

My ultimate goal is to be able to use this program as a virtual tool to play solo tabletop RPGs using the [*Wretched & Alone*](https://sealedlibrary.itch.io/wretched-alone-srd) system.
